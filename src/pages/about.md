# About Me

Hey there! I'm Brian, a senior technologist with a passion for serverless technologies and cloud infrastructure optimization. In general, I love learning and will capture lessons I'm learning along the way.

## What I Do

I work at a large enterprise where I focus on:

- **AWS Lambda development and optimization** - Building efficient serverless applications and helping teams make the most of Lambda's capabilities
- **Cloud infrastructure** - Designing and implementing scalable solutions for large scale cloud adoption
- **Developer experience** - Creating tools and frameworks that make developers' lives easier
- **Serverless Cost optimization** - Finding ways to run cloud infrastructure more efficiently without sacrificing performance
- **Serverless operations** - Sharing techniques for operating serverless applications

I've spent years working with serverless technologies, particularly AWS Lambda, and I love diving deep into the technical details that make these systems tick.

## My Interests

Beyond my day job, I'm really interested in:

- **Learning** - We live in an amazing time - there are just so many cool things going on
- **Business of technology** - I'm always fascinated to learn the stories behind how tech businesses get started and scale

## Outside of Tech

When I'm not working with cloud infrastructure or writing code, I love playing basketball. Not saying I'm any good but it definitely puts a smile on my face. I grew up in the 80s and probably watched way too much TV and too many movies. For better or worse I still love watching movies. My musical tastes are all over the place.

I'm truly blessed to have a loving wife and three awesome kids.

## Why This Blog?

I started Curious Dev because I believe in learning by sharing. Over the years, I've encountered countless technical challenges, discovered interesting solutions, and learned lessons that I want to pass on.

**My hopes for you as a reader:**

- **Learn practical skills** - Every post aims to teach something you can actually use, whether it's optimizing Lambda functions, reducing AWS costs, or implementing better development practices
- **Save time** - I write the guides I wish I had when I was figuring things out, hoping to help you avoid the pitfalls I encountered
- **Think deeper** - I don't just want to show you how to do something; I want to help you understand why it works the way it does
- **Stay curious** - Technology evolves rapidly, and the most valuable skill is knowing how to learn and adapt

I write for engineers who want to go beyond surface-level tutorials and really understand the systems they're building. If you're working with AWS, serverless technologies, or cloud infrastructure in general, I hope you'll find something valuable here.
